      intro_text_html: "<p>The Non Riservato network is a laboratory for new models of cooperation among projects, that belong to NR. It’s a shared and stable structure, and at the same time able to preserve the autonomy of the partners. It aims to improve the relationship between creative organisations, market and institutions, giving value to professional roles, increasing the skills of organisations with the topics sustainability, urban and social regeneration, design, management of creative interventions, urban and social projects, through an exchange of expertise and the creation of ad hoc learning programmes.</p>
      <p>NR is a network open to the entry of new partners, that apart from the styles they use, share the same philosophy and goals.</p>
      <p>Being a normal member means to be involved in this experimentation of social and professional innovation, to suggest projects and to adopt the projects of others, to compare oneself to a stimulating environment with different professionalism, to attend to the learning meetings and… why not? To do something great for the city of Milan and obviously to have a good time!</p>"
